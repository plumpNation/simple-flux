A simple vanilla introduction to Flux
=====================================

The purpose is to have an accompanying live coding session that will clearly demonstrate the power of working with a view state, and having components that  use that data to build and do not manipulate that view data directly.

It is written completely vanilla in order to show that the pattern is library and framework agnostic.

You can apply the pattern to one, some or all components within a view.

We start by creating a simple accordion component. It updates it's own state.

Then we move on to see why this won't scale as the view fills with components.

Checkout the branches stage{1-6} to see the progress of the demo.
